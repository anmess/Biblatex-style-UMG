# Biblatex-style-UMG
Here, we'll create the perfect biblatex style for a medical doctor thesis at the UMG!

Uploaded the current biblatex-stylefiles here:

 --> umg.bbx file (managing overall and specifically bibliography options)
 --> umg.cbx file (managing the in-text-citations)
 
They are newly created styles:

 --> umg.bbx is a copy of nejm.bbx (which in turn is based upon numeric.bbx, whose content was copied into the new umg.bbx stylefile), and already contains certain changes (marked as %A.M in the document's annotation)
 --> umg.cbx is a copy of authoryear.cbx, which also already contains changes, also marked as %A.M
